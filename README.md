# FINAL_CODE_PROJECT_The_gAItors
EEG Project
Epileptic seizures manifest themselves in EEG readings differently between males and females. Neuroscientific studies are often predominately conducted on male subjects. Solution: Develop an application capable of distinguishing between the EEG readings of male and female patients with epilepsy.

Our data comes from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database: https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/. It Consists of 23 EEG files (.edf): 5 male and 17 female subjects of pediatric age (between 3-20 years). 

Code is located in the file named FINAL_CODE_PROJECT_The_gAItors. 
Data for the females patients is located in the Female_stats_.xlsx
Data for male patients is located in the Male_stats_.xlsx.
